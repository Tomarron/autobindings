# Autobindings 

Autobindings is a simple extention to the amazing library [Binding](https://github.com/mholt/binding). So binding is a reflectionless data binding for Go's net/http. For that developer has to write a FieldMap function which is used by this library to map the incoming JSON from the request to the struct fields.

## What autobinding does ?
So it automatically creates FieldMap function for your struct. 

## How to use ?
Just add this line to all of your files which has struct and for which you want to create a FieldMap function

```
//go:generate autobindings <file_name>
```

Or

From command line just run

```
autobindings -file <file_name>
```

Or

If you don't want to create the automatic files, then use -print flag to just print the function associated with your struct on the console

```
autobindings -file <file_name> -print
```

Example 

```go
$ ./generator -file testfile.go -print
package main

/*
This is an autogenerated file by autobindings
*/

import (
  "github.com/mholt/binding"
)

func (i *Item) FieldMap() binding.FieldMap {
  return binding.FieldMap{
    &i.A: "A",
    &i.B: "B",
  }
}
```

## How to install ?
```
go install github.com/rainingclouds/autobindings
```

## How does it happens ?
Using the power of go generate :)
It creates <struct_name>_bindings.go for every struct in the given file. This file contains FieldMap function for that struct. This function is used by [Binding](https://github.com/mholt/binding) library to perform the mapping.

## Okay so what is missing ?
* It doesn't support Embedded fields yet.
